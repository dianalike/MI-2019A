This is Diana李可，a senior at Tsinghua major in English. 
My favorite formula is the accounting one:asset-liabilities=equities. (I dunno why lol)
My favorite text is "fake it till u make it"
I am so nervous and excited to use Github (definitely a first time experience)
Hope to rock the platform with all of u!
